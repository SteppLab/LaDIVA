# LaDIVA Radial Basisi Function Branch (Under Construction)
## DIVA connected to BCM Za√±artu 2014
### V007 - Hardcorded for Pitch Reflex : run one iteration, change perturbation magnitude, duration, direction
        * BCMlookuptable.m download from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Arn8HqNxDIot3IpTC7q68Wmqj7G_--lC/view?usp=sharing
        * Current version upladed to PLOS Comp Bio submission
        
### Under Construction
        * Generating radial basis functions for diffeent initial BCM lookup tables
        * To be added here - RBF generation codes, BCMlookuptable generation codes (fix the OUT OF MEMORY issues)
